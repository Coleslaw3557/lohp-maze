## What it is

The 14 ft arched sign spanning the two entrance towers (`camp-sign.svg`):
**"Legends of the ◉ Hidden Playa"** — 23 channel-lit letters plus the round
logo disc between "the" and "Hidden". Per the CAD: towers 3 ft W × 8 ft T on
11 ft centers (8 ft clear walk-through, 3+8+3 = 14 ft overall), band ends flush
with the tower tops, crest +19 in, band 21.6 in tall, big letters ~14 in,
"of the" ~6 in, logo disc **28.8 in Ø in the drawing** (the earlier notes said
24 in — measure the real disc before cutting strip; it's 7.5 vs 6.3 ft of
perimeter).

Every letter and the logo is one individually controllable RGB zone: **24 zones**.

**Letters are halo-lit raised cut-outs** (`letters-raised.jpg`): each letter
is cut separately and stands off the **solid** band on spacers — nothing is
cut out of the backing. The strip serpentines on the letter's **back with the
LEDs facing the band**, clipped down like the reference photo, so the letter
face stays dark wood and the color reads as a glow ring spilling around the
silhouette. Bonus: the strip and solder joints ride protected between letter
and band.

**Logo construction is tiki-style piece-work** (`logo.svg` = 91 wood pieces;
the a–h/1–82 text in the file are assembly labels, not artwork): the pieces
mount over a backlit disc and the design lives in the **gaps between them** —
LED light glows through the gap line-work, the wood blocks. So the logo's
strip is a serpentine/loop field **behind** the disc washing a diffuser, not a
perimeter ring.

## Architecture — one decision that drives everything

The sign is **not** a standalone WLED island running its own show. The Pi
remains the one show controller, and the sign is 24 more fixtures on the same
universe it already outputs — delivered, since the DMX-over-WiFi plan
(`dmx-over-wifi.md`, 2026-07-21), as **ArtDMX over the camp WiFi**, exactly
like every room node. The Dfi 2.4G DMX link that used to be this section is
demoted to **fallback**, bought/kept only if the entrance-tower WiFi fails its
on-site test — its full wiring stays documented below so bench day has it.

```

Consequences, all already in the repo:

- **Zones are ordinary fixtures.** `light_config.json` room **"Camp Sign"**,
  model `Camp Sign Zone - WS2811 via ESP32 DMX bridge`, 24 × 8-ch slots at
  **161–352** (8-aligned so the engine's `(start-1)//8` slotting holds).
  `main.py NUM_FIXTURES = 44` sizes the state, the FTDI frame and the sim
  universe from that one constant. 353 bytes @ 250 kbaud ≈ 15.6 ms — still
  comfortably 44 Hz.
- **Themes/effects need zero new code.** The theme engine already breathes the
  sign with the maze (verified: theme bytes on @161/@257/@345 in the sim), the
  panel's room list grows a "Camp Sign" entry, and any effect —
  Lightning, PoliceLights — runs on the sign like on any room.
- **Brightness is managed centrally** (master-brightness slider scales themes;
  effects are deliberate full-power moments). **No firmware brightness cap** —
  the wiring and fuses below are sized for 100% full-white instead, so software
  is never the overcurrent protection.
- The sim renders the sign from the same configs: per-letter live-DMX glyphs on
  the arch (Sign button; letter swatch strip above the fixture grid).

## DMX zone map (production config — change only via light_config.json)

Reading order, one 8-ch slot each. Byte layout matches the ZQ01424 par, so raw
effect frames land identically: `0=total_dimming 1=R 2=G 3=B 4=W 5=strobe
6-7=unused`.

| Zones | @DMX | Letters |
|---|---|---|
| 0–6 | 161, 169, 177, 185, 193, 201, 209 | L e g e n d s |

Free above the sign: **353–512** (20 more 8-ch slots). First reservation if the
tiki niches in the pillar faces (30×48 in rounded panels in the CAD detail)
ever get backlights: 4 zones @353–384, `NUM_FIXTURES 44→48`.

## The ESP32 bridge

**Board: XIAO ESP32-S3** — fleet standard, already stocked for room audio, and
it has 4 RMT TX channels = exactly the 4 pixel outputs (the C3 only has 2).

**Firmware is net-new** — a custom IDF/Arduino sketch: ArtDMX-over-UDP receive
(trivial — mirror the parser in `sim/esphome/components/artnet_dmx/`, the room
nodes' component) + FastLED on 4 RMT outputs. DMX *input* only exists on the
Dfi fallback path: that's where [`esp_dmx`](https://github.com/someweisguy/esp_dmx)
comes in ([`ESP32S3DMX`](https://github.com/TimRosener/ESP32S3DMX) is an
S3-specific RX alternative if esp_dmx fights Arduino Core 3.x on bench day) —
leave it out of the build unless the tower WiFi test fails. It is deliberately
dumb — all show logic stays on the Pi:

1. Receive the universe as **ArtDMX on UDP :6454 over WiFi** — the same
   packets the room nodes take (`artnet.py` builds them; the parse is ~20
   lines, mirror `sim/esphome/components/artnet_dmx/`). `dmx_nodes.json` gets
   the bridge as room "Camp Sign". **Fallback input** (tower WiFi fails the
   site test): wired DMX on UART1 via a plain RS485→TTL module **fed 3.3V**
   (HiLetgo auto-flow class) hanging off the Dfi RX. The old plan's isolated
   Waveshare converter was dropped 2026-07-19 after reading its listing: its
   differentiators — galvanic power/digital isolation, TVS surge,
   lightning-proofing, onboard 120R — all defend a long copper run between
   separately-powered structures, and the radio (now WiFi) hop eliminated
   that run. The RX and the ESP32 share one PSU inches apart; plain
   conversion is the whole remaining job (and RX-only use makes
   auto-direction timing moot at 250 kbaud).
2. For each zone `k` (0–23): slot base = `160 + 8k` (0-indexed). Decode
   **exactly like the sim's `decodeFixture`** so preview == wire:
   `R = min(255, r + 0.92w) × total/255`, same for G, `B = min(255, b + 0.85w)
   × total/255`; `strobe > 5` gates the zone at `1 + (strobe/255)×11` Hz, 50%
   duty.
3. Write each zone's value to its letter's pixel range (table below) on the
   group's output. Bytes 6–7 ignored.
4. **DMX-loss fallback**: no valid frame for 3 s → slow amber breathe (the camp
   sign shouldn't go black because the Pi rebooted); resume on the next frame.
   An all-zero frame is NOT loss — a deliberate blackout stays a blackout.

                  120Ω across A-B at the module (the RX stub is its own tiny bus;
                  the wired maze chain keeps its own 120Ω at its last fixture)

```

The on-hand **TXS0108E modules are not a substitute** for the AHCT here
(considered 2026-07-19): auto-direction translators drive through one-shot
accelerators and hold with weak ~10 k pull-ups — fine between chips on a PCB,
but into wire + a WS2811 input the weak hold and reflection-retriggered
one-shots produce random sparkle that reads as broken firmware. The AHCT is
bought specifically for its strong push-pull line drive. (Keep the TXS stock
for bidirectional short-haul buses like I2C.)

Controller lives behind the removable logo disc; strips run center-out so every
group's pixel 0 is near it ("Legends" runs s→L, reversed in the zone table;
"Hidden"/"Playa" run outward normally; "of the"+logo starts at center).

**Letter→pixel table** (firmware constant, filled in during the build — count
pixels as installed, 1 pixel = one 3-LED WS2811 group ≈ 2 in):

| Output | Zone | Letter | px start | px end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 6→0 | s…L (reversed) | _ | _ |
| 2 | 7–11, 12 | o f t h e, ◉ | _ | _ |
| 3 | 13–18 | H…n | _ | _ |
| 4 | 19–23 | P…a | _ | _ |

## LED strip + per-letter budget

**12V WS2811, 60 LED/m, IP65 silicone-coat, black PCB** — 20 pixels/m,
cuttable every ~2 in — IP65 over IP67 tube on purpose: thinner, clips flat to
the letter backs and takes the serpentine bends, still dust-sealed,
≤14.4 W/m. From the CAD letter sizes:

Per-letter strip = the back-fill serpentine (LEDs toward the band), not an
outline trace:

| Item | Strip | Pixels |
|---|---|---|
| 18 big letters (~14 in) | ~0.7 m each → 12.6 m | ~14 px each |
| 5 small letters (~6 in) | ~0.3 m each → 1.5 m | ~6 px each |
| Logo backlight field (28.8 in Ø disc, serpentine behind the diffuser) | ~2.5–3 m | ~50–60 px |
| **Installed total** | **~17–19 m** | **~340–390 px** |

**Buy four 5 m reels** (20 m): covers the ~17–19 m install + per-letter cut
waste; add a fifth only if you want repair stock. Full-white worst case ≈ 17–19 m × 14.4 W/m = **245–275 W,
20–23 A @ 12V** — the 500 W/42A ABI supply loafs at ~60% (treat it as 400 W
continuous; bring the second ABI as the onsite spare).

## Power distribution (sized for full white, no software cap)

```text
PSU+ ── 35A main fuse ── distribution block (left pillar, with PSU + controller)
          ├─ 10A ── 14AWG ── "Legends" feed + mid-string injection
          ├─ 7.5A ── 14AWG ── "of the" + logo feed
          ├─ 2A ──── 18AWG ── buck/controller
          └─ 20A ── 10AWG trunk across the arch ── right-pillar fuse block
                      ├─ 7.5A ── "Hidden" feed + injection
                      └─ 7.5A ── "Playa" feed
PSU− ── common negative bus (both pillars bridged by the trunk's return)
```

- Fuse math: `strip meters × 1.2 A`, fuse the next size up; **fuses protect the
  wire**, so never fuse above the wire's rating (14 AWG→15 A max, 16→10, 18→7).
- **Inject 12V every ~8 ft** and at the far end of each group — never carry
  power across the whole sign on strip copper. Every injection + is fused at
  its block; all returns to the common bus. One PSU feeds everything, so
  both-ends feeding is fine.
- PSU mounted vertically inside a pillar: baffled vent path, fan clearance,
  rain/dust shielded but **not airtight** (it's fan-cooled), strain relief,
  terminals reachable.
- 120V: inverter-generator feed, **no GFCI in the chain** (floating-neutral
  inverter sets nuisance-trip and protect nothing without an N-G bond) →
  outdoor 3-conductor cord → covered mains terminals, chassis ground bonded to
  the PSU housing, accessible disconnect. ~300 W LED load ≈ 3 A @ 120V.
- AC section physically separated from DMX/data/12V runs.

## Connectors + playa-proofing

- xConnect-style 3-pin waterproof connectors at every group boundary and the
  logo disc (it's removable — controller access); separate 2-pin pigtails for
  injection points.
- Every cut end: sealed, adhesive-lined heat shrink, **neutral-cure** silicone
  only (acidic silicone corrodes the copper), strain relief so solder pads
  never carry cable tension.
- The Dfi RX rides inside the sign (dry, antenna clear of the steel-adjacent
  clutter); its short stub to the RS485 module is terminated at the module.
  Nothing long enters the pillar but the AC cord.

## Build + bench sequence

1. Bench the bridge first, indoors, before any strip is cut: S3 + RS485→TTL
   module with the Dfi pair inline (TX on the bench chain behind a par, RX →
   stub) → verify frame reception at @161+ (same bench flow as the C3 node
   bring-up). Bench the same TX placement you'll rig (Y-stub vs chain end).
2. Install tape letter by letter; **count pixels per letter into the firmware
   table as you go**.
3. Wire groups center-out, injection stubs every 8 ft, nothing fused yet.
4. Measure each group's actual meters → final fuse sizes (×1.2 A rule).
5. Flash the zone table; test each output alone, then all four.
6. Full white soak: measure 12V at the farthest pixel of every group; add
   injection anywhere below ~11.5V.
7. Run the sign 8+ hours on the bench PSU before transport.
8. Pack: spare ABI PSU, a spare S3 from the fleet, the extra HiLetgo modules
   (5-pack), a coiled DMX cable (wired fallback), fuses, connectors.

## Open items

- [ ] Logo disc: 24 in (notes) vs **28.8 in (CAD)** — measure before strip buy.
- [ ] Logo diffuser between the strip field and the wood pieces (opal acrylic
      vs sanded poly sheet) — gap lines are ~thin, so evenness matters more
      than output.
- [ ] Dfi 2.4G at playa RF density: pair + channel-select at camp, verify the
      ~50 ft hop is solid with camp WiFi up, and keep a DMX cable coiled as
      the wired fallback (LumenRadio CRMX is the $$$ escalation). TX tap =
      Y-stub at the rack or the last fixture's OUT — either way the wired
      chain keeps its own 120Ω at its far end.
- [ ] Letter standoff depth: the halo needs ~0.75–1.5 in of air behind each
      letter to bloom (reference photo uses ~1 in metal standoffs) — pick one
      spacer length fleet-wide and it doubles as the wiring chase.
- [ ] Tiki niche backlights in the pillar faces (4 × 30×48 in panels): zones
      reserved @353–384, not built.
- [ ] Per-letter chase/marquee effects: the engine currently applies one
      effect uniformly per room — a sign-specific runner that phases an effect
      across zones 0–23 would unlock marquee sweeps (sim previews it the day
      it exists).
- [ ] When no theme runs, the maze resets fixtures to zero → sign goes dark
      (correct for blackouts). If the sign should idle-glow all night, that's
      a Pi-side decision (always-run a theme, or a tiny "sign idle" writer) —
      not firmware.
